# Predicting the Severity of Car Accidents
## Description

This project involves analyzing a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The dataset contains 2.8 million accident records collected from February 2016 to Dec 2021, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data.

The objective of this project is to build a model that can predict the severity of a car accident using important variables. The project used the random forest method to identify the important variables and then built a model that achieved an accuracy of 94.48%.

This project ranked second among 12 teams in a data analysis competition.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about car accidents, such as location, time, weather, road conditions, and severity of the accident.

The most common cause of death of teenagers and younger adults is a vehicle accident. Over the past few years, fatalities in vehicle crashes have been declining, but there were still 39,404 fatalities in 2018.
